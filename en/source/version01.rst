##################################################

In order to facilitate GDDAQ users to be familiar with the logic functions of Pixie-16 module and the characteristics of PKU firmware, this firmware was specially developed for teaching. Users can download the corresponding version firmware and web control program at https://github.com/wuhongyi/MZTIO/ .

The *version/01* folder contains the firmware *xillydemo.bit* and the control web *www* folder. **This firmware and its supporting control program can only be used for learning, please contact Hongyi Wu get the experimental version.**


The top 12 RJ-45 connectors on the front panel of the MZTIO are represented by the following symbols from top to bottom: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4. The RJ-45 connector on the Pixie-16 module in the PKU firmware outputs the multiplicity logic signals of channel 0 and channel 1, which are denoted by _I and _II, respectively. Then A1_I represents the multiplicity logic of channel 0 in the Pixie-16 module connected to the first RJ-45 port of MZTIO.

The button "Program FPGA" is used to initialize the system configuration. When the operating system is powered on, click this button to complete the system initialization.

Five experimental setup parameters can be saved, which are "Experimental setup 1-5". After modifying the register to configure the experiment logic, user can click the "Save" button to save, and the current FPGA register parameters will be saved to the selected experiment configuration. The button "Load" is used to load the selected experiment configuration into the FPGA.

The four LEMO input channels are named LEMO1, LEMO2, LEMO3, LEMO4. The LEMO4 is connected to the "run inhibit" signal on the back panel of the chassis. When the input signal is high, the acquisition system stops running.

The monitoring part of the oscilloscope is used to select the output signals of the four LEMO output channels. The following table lists all currently available options. Click the "Read" button to read the current setting parameters. The button "Change" is used to write the parameters of the current input box to the FPGA.

The register setting part is used to read or modify register setting parameters. When reading the register, user need to enter the address of the register to be read, and then click the button "Read"; when modifying the register, input the address and parameter value of the register to be modified, and then click the button "Write".

The webpage can also be used to shut down the LINUX operating system in MZTIO. Clicking the red button "SHUTDOWN OS" will immediately shut down the operating system. After that, user will not be able to access the webpage. User need to power on again to start the operating system before use. This button is only used to shut down the MZTIO operating system before shutting down the chassis.


The yellow button "UPDATE FW" is used to upgrade the firmware and restart the operating system. The firmware to be upgraded needs to be placed in the */root* directory, and then click the button. If the firmware upgrade is successful, the web page will prompt that the operating system will restart after one minute, if the upgrade fails, it prompts that the firmware file cannot be found.

.. image:: /_static/img/version01_status.png


This page is used for real-time count rate monitoring. The current version includes the count rate of 4 LEMO input channels, 4 LEMO output channels, Multi_A-H, OR_A-H, and 12 RJ-45 connectors input (Pixie-16 output multiplicity).

Time difference measurement
============================================================
	   
.. image:: /_static/img/version01_timediff.png

This page implements the time difference measurement of any two logic signals (chA-chB, a time difference greater than 0 means that the chA signal is later than the chB signal). The button "Read" is used to read the signal source parameters; the button "Write" is used to change the signal source; the button "Clear" is used to clear the time difference spectrum in the FPGA. When the signal source is changed, the time difference spectrum in the FPGA must be cleared. The button “Update” can be used to read the current time difference spectrum from the FPGA and display it on the web page.
